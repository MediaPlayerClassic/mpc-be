Changes since the last public release (1.6.18):

Version 1.6.19beta01 [July 30, 2015]

  Updated obsolete information about the simplified API macros in the
    manual pages (Bug report by Arc Riley).
  Avoid potentially dereferencing NULL info_ptr in png_info_init_3().
  Rearranged png.h to put the major sections in the same order as
    in libpng17.
  Eliminated unused PNG_COST_SHIFT, PNG_WEIGHT_SHIFT, PNG_COST_FACTOR, and
    PNG_WEIGHT_FACTOR macros.
  Suppressed some warnings from the Borland C++ 5.5.1/5.82 compiler
    (Bug report by Viktor Szakats).  Several warnings remain and are
    unavoidable, where we test for overflow.
  Fixed potential leak of png_pixels in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c
  Fixed uninitialized variable in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c

Version 1.6.19beta02 [August 19, 2015]
  Moved config.h.in~ from the "libpng_autotools_files" list to the
    "libpng_autotools_extra" list in autogen.sh because it was causing a
    false positive for missing files (bug report by Robert C. Seacord).
  Removed unreachable "break" statements in png.c, pngread.c, and pngrtran.c
    to suppress clang warnings (Bug report by Viktor Szakats).
  Fixed some bad links in the man page.
  Changed "n bit" to "n-bit" in comments.
  Added signed/unsigned 16-bit safety net. This removes the dubious
    0x8000 flag definitions on 16-bit systems. They aren't supported
    yet the defs *probably* work, however it seems much safer to do this
    and be advised if anyone, contrary to advice, is building libpng 1.6
    on a 16-bit system. It also adds back various switch default clauses
    for GCC; GCC errors out if they are not present (with an appropriately
    high level of warnings).
  Safely convert num_bytes to a png_byte in png_set_sig_bytes() (Robert
    Seacord).
  Fixed the recently reported 1's complement security issue by replacing
    the value that is illegal in the PNG spec, in both signed and unsigned
    values, with 0. Illegal unsigned values (anything greater than or equal
    to  0x80000000) can still pass through, but since these are not illegal
    in ANSI-C (unlike 0x80000000 in the signed case) the checking that
    occurs later can catch them (John Bowler).

Version 1.6.19beta03 [August 21, 2015]
  Fixed png_save_int_32 when int is not 2's complement (John Bowler).
